For those who always wanted to know what \"arrows of chance / gaming arrows\" were. Lane gives quite a detailed description of what was involved. I'll explain my take on it: a group of 10 (or however many there are) buys an animal on credit (e.g. camel), they slaughter the animal and divide it into 10 portions (equaling the number of people in the group). They assign a number to each portion of meat, e.g. portion 1 is marked 1, portion 2 is marked 2, portion 3 is marked 3 etc up to 10. They take 10 arrow heads (no feathers) and mark each arrow head with a number, arrow head 1 marked 1 (this corresponds to meat portion 1), arrow head 2 marked 2 (this corresponds to meat portion 2) etc up to 7, arrows 8, 9 and 10 are left with no mark. They assign a person to shuffle the arrow heads and distribute them to the 10 players. If someone gets arrow 1 they take meat portion 1, if someone gets arrow 2 they take meat portion 2 and so on. Whoever gets the unmarked arrows (3 people in this example) have to pay the entire value of the slaughtered animal, that was initially bought on credit.. . Yassara (prf. 3rd. p. m. sing.
